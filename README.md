# MHkala
A project in Advanced Programming course (Dr. Vahidi Asl), Spring 1399 semester  

## This is a very simple store interface which you can buy a product as a customer, add a product to store as a producer and transfer a product to customer as transporter. Main character in this project is Admin.

### as we said 4 characters are in this project. Each one has a special username and one password which can be set for customers by thmeselves and for transporter and producer by admin like himself.

### Transporter class has multiple choices for vehicle to use for transporting products to customers which obviousley are different in transportation time.

### Producer can add multiple types of products.

### Admin can set sales or give them up, add producers and transporters.

### All of the said features and some more intresting things, all in a terminal interface somehow well designed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
